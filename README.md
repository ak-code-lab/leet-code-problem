# AK Code Lab - LeetCode Solutions

## About

Welcome to the AK Code Lab repository of LeetCode solutions! This collection features a curated set of coding problems and their solutions, arranged in a 10-day progression from beginner to advanced level. Each solution is implemented in C programming language with detailed comments to help you understand the approach.

## Structure

The solutions are organized by days, with each day containing multiple problems of increasing complexity:

- **Days 1-3**: Beginner level problems focusing on basic programming concepts
- **Days 4-6**: Intermediate level problems involving more complex algorithms
- **Days 7-8**: Advanced beginner problems that combine multiple concepts
- **Days 9-10**: Advanced problems requiring deeper algorithmic understanding


## How to Use This Repository

1. Start with Day 1 and progress sequentially
2. Read the problem statement first and try to solve it on your own
3. Compare your solution with the provided implementation
4. Understand the approach and time/space complexity
5. Practice by implementing variations of the problems

## Example Problems

Some of the key problems covered in this collection include:

- Finding unique elements in arrays
- String manipulation and character counting
- Mathematical conversions (binary, hexadecimal, etc.)
- Pattern matching and recognition

## Learning Path

This repository is designed to help you build your coding skills systematically:

- **Beginner**: Focus on understanding the basics of algorithms and data structures
- **Intermediate**: Learn to optimize your solutions for better time and space complexity
- **Advanced**: Master complex problem-solving techniques used in coding interviews
